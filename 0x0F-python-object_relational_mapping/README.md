## More Info
### Install and activate venv
To create a Python Virtual Environment, allowing you to install specific dependencies for this python project, we will install venv:

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3.8-venv
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install MySQLdb module version 2.0.x
For installing MySQLdb, you need to have MySQL installed: How to install MySQL 8.0 in Ubuntu 20.04

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
$ sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
$ sudo pip3 install mysqlclient
...
$ python3
>>> import MySQLdb
>>> MySQLdb.version_info 
(2, 0, 3, 'final', 0)
```

### Install SQLAlchemy module version 1.4.x
```
$ sudo pip3 install SQLAlchemy
...
$ python3
>>> import sqlalchemy
>>> sqlalchemy.__version__ 
'1.4.22'
```

## Tasks
### 0. Get all states
Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name (no argument validation needed)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported

### 1. Filter states
Write a script that lists all states with a name starting with N (upper N) from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:

Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name (no argument validation needed)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
Your code should not be executed when imported

### 2. Filter states by user input
Write a script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument.

Your script should take 4 arguments: mysql username, mysql password, database name and state name searched (no argument validation needed)
You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)

### 3. SQL Injection...
Wait, do you remember the previous task? Did you test "Arizona'; TRUNCATE TABLE states ; SELECT * FROM states WHERE name = '" as an input?
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0F$ ./2-my_filter_states.py root root hbtn_0e_0_usa "Arizona'; TRUNCATE TABLE states ; SELECT * FROM states WHERE name = '"
(2, 'Arizona')
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0F$ ./0-select_states.py root root hbtn_0e_0_usa
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0F$ 
```
What? Empty?

Yes, it’s an SQL injection to delete all records of a table…
